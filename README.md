# Doubly-Linked-Lists
Doubly Linked List (D-LL) is little bit advance than the Singly Linked List (S-LL). It holds two links and the data element. This specialty offers more flexibility to D-LL than S-LLs. With compared to arrays, D-LLs are fare more flexible (expandable and accessible). Since D-LLs are dynamically expandable, memory consumption is comparatively high.



## About the source

This source is just to understand linked lists. I have used gcc version 6.3.0 c++14 compiler but this program can be compiled and run in any lower versions for sure. 

You can use below command to compile the source in both Ubuntu and Windows environments.
